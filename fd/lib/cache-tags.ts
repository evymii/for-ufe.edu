/**
 * Cache-tag registry — the one shared constant surface between the public

 * Every public content fetch is tagged; after an admin save the browser
 * POSTs /api/revalidate with the affected tag so the next public request
 * refetches fresh data instead of waiting out the 60s ISR window. Adding a
 * new managed resource means adding its tag here AND using it on the fetch —
